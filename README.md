Web application for sharing public transport experiences

Objective Develop a web application where users could share their experience after using public transportation. Description The application should allow to create an account where the user should share an experience after he used public transportation. For anonymous users the application would allow searching and viewing existing experiences from the platform.

Functionalities (minimal)

User Module Create an account based on some completed fields or based on an external API (Gmail, Facebook, Linkedin) The ability to modify or disable the account Password recovery

Sharing Module Sharing an experience would require to complete the following fields: Starting point (A) Destination point (B) Public transport that was used: bus, metro, tram, etc. Departure hour Trip duration Crowdedness level of the public transport Observations Satisfaction level (smiley faces) Edit a shared experience of a user Listing all the experiences shared by a user Delete an experience

Searching module The search module should allow the user to find an experience or a list of experiences based on one or multiple keywords. The results will be displayed as a list. This module should return the results based on location, used transportation or destination.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
